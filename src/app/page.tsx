          Started my coding journey some time ago and I haven&apos;t really
          tracked it much, so I felt like creating a page where I can track my
          progress and see it visually, and also write about my learnings. The
          data from here would be from after August of 2025. Don&apos;t have
          much data from previous months, but I plan to keep it going now.
